                    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                    <li>1 pound bulk mild Italian sausage</li>

                    <li>1 ¼ teaspoons crushed red pepper flakes</li>
                    
                    <li>4 slices bacon, cut into 1/2 inch pieces</li>
                    
                    <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
                    
                    <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
                    
                    <li>5 (13.75 ounce) cans chicken broth</li>
                    
                    <li>6 potatoes, thinly sliced</li> 
                    
                    <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
                    
                   <li>¼ bunch fresh spinach, tough stems removed</li>

                   <ol>
                    <h2>Steps</h2>
                    <h3>Step 1</h3>
                    <li>Cook the Italian sausage and red pepper flakes in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat until crumbly, browned, and no longer pink,
                     10 to 15 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
                    
                     <h3>Step 2</h3>
                    <li>Cook the bacon in the same Dutch oven over medium heat until crisp, about 10 minutes. Drain, leaving a few tablespoons of drippings 
                        with the bacon in the bottom of the Dutch oven. Stir in the onions and garlic; 
                        cook until onions are soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
                    
                        <h3>Step 3</h3>
                    <li>Pour the chicken broth into the Dutch oven with the bacon and onion mixture; 
                        bring to a boil over high heat. Add the potatoes, and boil until fork tender, about 20 minutes.
                         Reduce the heat to medium and stir in the heavy cream and the cooked sausage; heat through. 
                         Mix the spinach into the soup just before serving.</li>
                        
                    </ol>
